# Issue Guidelines

Welcome to 'IUnico Server' project's issue tracking system.

We're delighted to receive your feedback and reports.  
Before you do so, please read these guidelines on how to open and manage issues effectively.

## How to Open an Issue

1.  _Check if the issue already exists_: before opening a new issue, make sure that someone else hasn't already opened a similar or related issue. You can search through the existing issues to check.
2.  Click on "Issues" at the top of the repository.
3.  Click on "New Issue" to create a new report.
4.  Choose the Issue Type. Select the type of issue you want to open (e.g., "Bug Report", "Feature Request" or "Question").
5.  Provide a clear and descriptive title.
6.  In the description, explain the problem or desired feature in a simple and concise manner.
7.  Make sure to include any relevant information, such as the operating system or software version.

## Labeling Issues

- Use labels to categorize issues (for example, use "bug" for problems and "enhancement" for new features).
- Assign labels to issues based on their type and importance.

## Team Response

- The team is committed to responding to issues as soon as possible.
- We may ask for additional details or evidence in case of problems.

Thank you for your contribution!
